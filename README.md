## Description üìù

This repository contains my personal solutions, notes, and approaches for various [OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/) wargames challenges. These wargames help in learning and practicing security concepts in a fun and challenging way.

> **Note**: These are my personal notes and solutions. I recommend trying to solve the challenges yourself before looking at any solutions!

## Wargames Overview üèÜ

### Bandit

Bandit is aimed at absolute beginners. It teaches the basics of many common Unix utilities and is a great starting point for those new to Linux and command line environments. The challenges cover skills like:

- Basic Linux commands
- File permissions
- Data encoding/decoding
- Shell scripting
- Network protocols (SSH, HTTP, etc.)

### Krypton

Krypton focuses on teaching cryptography principles through increasingly challenging encryption puzzles. Players learn about:

- Basic cryptographic techniques
- Substitution ciphers
- XOR encryption
- Frequency analysis
- Cryptanalysis methods

### Leviathan

Leviathan is a small wargame with few levels but requires careful reverse engineering and problem-solving skills. It focuses on:

- Binary analysis
- Privilege escalation
- Executable permissions
- Linux security concepts

### Natas

Natas teaches the basics of serverside web security. Each level contains a vulnerability that must be exploited to gain access to the next level. Challenges include:

- Basic web security concepts
- SQL injection
- Session management
- Server-side request forgery
- File inclusion vulnerabilities
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
